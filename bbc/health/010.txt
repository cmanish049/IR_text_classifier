US health panel releases new breast cancer screening guidelines

A body of US medical experts is recommending women begin preventative breast cancer screening a decade earlier than under current guidelines.

They recommend preventative mammograms starting at age 40 with regular screenings every other year.

The draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPS) are now under review.

Previous guidelines suggested most women start screening at age 50.

The task force - made up of doctors and disease experts who look at research on the best way to prevent diseases - said that, if adopted, the new recommendations could save the lives of an additional 19% of American women.

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among US women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and nearly 13% of American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lifetimes.

The new screening guidelines are especially crucial for black women, who are "40% more likely to die from breast cancer than white women", the task force said on Tuesday.

"Ensuring Black women start screening at age 40 is an important first step, yet it is not enough to improve the health inequities we face related to breast cancer," Vice Chair Dr Wanda Nicholson said in a statement.

The new draft guidelines would apply to women who have an average risk for breast cancer, or a family history of the disease. It also includes women with other risk factors like dense breast tissue, a condition that can both increase the risk of cancer and make it harder to detect using mammograms.

The guidelines would not, however, apply to women who have a genetic risk of breast cancer, such as the BRCA1 genetic mutation.
