Cancer: Mum writes book to help child cope with her diagnosis

How am I going to tell my child? That was the first thing that crossed Hollie McFarlane's mind when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

She and her daughter Sydney, four, are very close and spent a lot of time together while Hollie's husband worked away during the week.

Their weekly routine included the library, pizza night, swimming, McDonald's and the zoo.

But eight months ago their lives "changed overnight".

The 43-year-old from Pwllheli found a lump in her breast in October last year after putting Sydney back to bed after a nightmare.

"Everyone was saying to me 'you've got absolutely nothing to worry about, you've lost weight and your body is just changing'," Hollie said, but she booked a check-up anyway.

"The day came and I was absolutely convinced that it was nothing to worry about."

But the English and Drama teacher was "absolutely floored" after seeing the look on her doctor and nurses' face.

Her husband, Mike, quit his job and didn't leave the pair's side for the next five months.

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK and one in seven women are diagnosed during their lifetime, according to the NHS.
