Migraine: Ceredigion woman says condition controls her life

A woman who has about nine migraines a month has said the condition controls her life.

Delyth Jones, 32, from Ceredigion, said she has missed her children's school concerts and sports days due to them.

A former GP who lost her job after a chronic migraine diagnosis has set up a voluntary support group in Cardiff, citing a lack of support.

The Welsh government said it was committed to improving care and services.

Ms Jones first started having migraines as a teenager and described the pain as "intense".

"It starts as a little tingling behind my eye, and I think 'oh yes, I'm going to have a migraine today'," she said.

"[It's] a huge pressure running back towards the back of my head from my eye. The pain, I can't describe it."

Ms Jones said some of her migraines can last for days.

"As a mother of three, it affects my life massively. I've missed out on things that they do, school concerts, sports days," she said.

"I've turned into an anxious person. Anxious that people don't believe me when I say that I have one. I feel isolated.

"Not many other people I know have them and I can't talk to other people about how I feel because they don't understand."

Ms Jones said she struggled with a lack of support when she went to see the doctor about her migraines.
