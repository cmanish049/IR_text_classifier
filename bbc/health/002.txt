Aspartame - is it a possible cause of cancer?

The sweetener aspartame, which is found in a variety of foods and fizzy drinks, is set to be officially classified as "possibly carcinogenic" to humans, reports claim.

The label frequently causes confusion as it gives no sense of whether the potential risk is big or miniscule.

Other "possibly carcinogenic" substances include aloe vera, diesel and pickled Asian vegetables.

The BBC understands the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) will make an announcement on 14 July.

Aspartame is 200 times sweeter than sugar, so it gives the taste without the calories.

You will find it on the ingredients list of many diet or sugar-free foods including diet drinks, chewing gums and some yoghurts. High profile drinks containing aspartame include Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Pepsi Max, and 7 Up Free, but the sweetener is in around 6,000 food products.

The sweetener has been used for decades and approved by food safety bodies, but there has been a swirl of controversy around the ingredient.

IARC, the cancer research arm of the World Health Organization, has been reviewing about 1,300 studies on aspartame and cancer.

The Reuters news agency says it has spoken to sources close to the process, and aspartame will be classified "possibly carcinogenic" - but what does the classification actually mean?

The BBC understands official announcements will be made by IARC and a separate expert committee on food additives - alongside a publication in the Lancet Oncology medical journal on 14 July.
